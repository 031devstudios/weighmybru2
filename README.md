This project is a smart coffee scale with a webserver hosted on the ESP32-S3.
This scale was designed to be used in conjunction with GaggiMate, but can also be used as a standalone scale. The project is still in a beta phase and is actively being worked on. Please head over to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYp4TSEjSf) server for more info. This scale was inspired by [EspressiScale](https://www.espressiscale.com) but with a non-custom PCB approach. The idea is to be low-cost, easily sourcable scale.
