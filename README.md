This project is a smart coffee scale with a webserver hosted on the ESP32-S3.
This scale was designed to be used in conjunction with GaggiMate, but can also be used as a standalone scale. The project is still in a beta phase and is actively being worked on. Please head over to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYp4TSEjSf) server for more info. This scale was inspired by [EspressiScale](https://www.espressiscale.com) but with a non-custom PCB approach. The idea is to be low-cost, easily sourcable scale.

## Installation

Installation instructions are currently under development, for now follow the [link](https://031devstudios.github.io/weighmybru-docs/#/installation/flashing) for step-by-step installation instructions. Additionally, a video is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5SP40Liuq0)

```
  this project requires VSCode with PlatformIO extension installed
```

### Important: Filesystem Upload Required

After uploading the firmware, you **must also upload the filesystem** for the web interface to work:

```bash
# Upload filesystem (required for web interface)
pio run -t uploadfs

# Or use the specific environment for your board
pio run -e esp32s3-supermini -t uploadfs  # For ESP32-S3 Supermini
pio run -e esp32s3-xiao -t uploadfs       # For XIAO ESP32S3
```

**Without the filesystem upload:**
- The device will function normally for scale operations
- The web interface will be unavailable
- You'll see a clear message explaining how to fix this issue

### 🌐 Web-Based Installation (Recommended)

For beginners, we now support **ESP32 Web Tools** for easy browser-based installation:

1. **Visit [weighmybru.com](https://weighmybru.com)** 
2. **Connect your ESP32 board** via USB
3. **Click "Install Firmware"** and select your board:
   - ESP32-S3 Supermini
   - XIAO ESP32S3
4. **Follow the prompts** - no software installation required!

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No need to install VS Code or PlatformIO
- ✅ Automatic latest firmware version
- ✅ Complete installation (firmware + filesystem)
- ✅ Works on any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Opera)
- ✅ Version checking and device information

For advanced users or development, continue with the PlatformIO instructions below.
