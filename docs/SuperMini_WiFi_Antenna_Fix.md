# ESP32-S3 SuperMini WiFi Antenna Fix

## Problem Description

Some ESP32-S3 SuperMini development boards have a hardware design issue where:
- WiFi only works when physically touching the antenna
- Poor WiFi connectivity or complete failure to connect
- Issues are more pronounced at distance from the router

## Root Cause

The issue is caused by:
1. **Poor antenna design** - inadequate antenna keep-out clearance
2. **GPIO interference** - GPIO21 can interfere with antenna performance
3. **Low default TX power** - insufficient power for poor antenna design

## Software Solution

This fix implements maximum WiFi transmission power to compensate for the antenna issues:

### Implementation Details

```cpp
// Enable maximum TX power at both framework levels
WiFi.setTxPower(WIFI_POWER_19_5dBm);        // Arduino framework: 19.5dBm
esp_wifi_set_max_tx_power(40);              // ESP-IDF level: 10dBm (40 = 4 * 10dBm)
```

### Configuration

The fix can be enabled/disabled in `WiFiManager.h`:

```cpp
#define ENABLE_SUPERMINI_ANTENNA_FIX true    // Enable for problematic boards
#define ENABLE_SUPERMINI_ANTENNA_FIX false   // Disable for normal boards
```

### When to Use

**Enable this fix if:**
- WiFi only works when touching the antenna
- Poor WiFi connectivity on SuperMini boards
- Connection fails at normal distances from router
- Board has insufficient antenna keep-out clearance

**Disable this fix if:**
- Using high-quality boards with proper antenna design
- Want to minimize power consumption
- Board already has reliable WiFi connectivity

## Hardware Solutions (Alternative)

For permanent hardware fixes:

1. **GPIO21 Issue**: Remove LED or connections on GPIO21
2. **External Antenna**: Add u.FL connector and external antenna
3. **Better Boards**: Use boards with proper antenna keep-out design

## Technical Notes

- Power settings are reapplied after WiFi mode switches
- Compatible with BLE coexistence (WiFi sleep mode maintained)
- Minimal performance impact on properly designed boards
- Automatic fallback if ESP-IDF functions unavailable

## Testing

Test effectiveness by:
1. Enable fix and upload firmware
2. Test WiFi connectivity without touching antenna
3. Check connection stability at various distances
4. Monitor serial output for power setting confirmations
